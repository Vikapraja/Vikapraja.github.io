    <div class="theory">
        <span>The Event loop is fspanndamental concept in js taht enables non-blocking  asynchronospans
            progarmming.  
        </span>
        <span> It allow JavaScript to perform task like handling user intraction, making network request
            (API calling) and processing timers while still maintaining a single thread environment. Here 
            a detailed explaination of how it works?        
        </span>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <u>Single-thread nature :</u>
                Js runs in a single thread, which means it can only execute one piece of code at a time
                This design helps to avoid issues like condition that can occur in Multitasking(threa Id)
                environment. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <u>Callback :</u>
                The callback a data structure that keeps track of function calls in your program. When 
                a function is invocked, its added to stack and when it completes, it removed. The 
                Call-stack fallow a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) Structure.   
            </li>
            <li>
                <u>Web-API :</u>
                Js environment such as browser provide web-API's (like setTimeOut,fetch and DOM Events) 
                that can handle tasks asynchronously. When you call an asynchronous function. The
                Task is offloaded to the web-API, Which executes it and put its callback inti a queue
                when its ready .
            </li>
            <li>
                <u>Callback Queue :</u>
                Once an asynchronous operations (Like a timer or a network request) is complete
                the corresponding, callback function is pushed into the callback queue (or task queue)
                This queue holds all the callbacks that are waiting to be executed after current
                all back is cleared.  
            </li>

            <li>
                <u>Event Loop :</u>
                The Event Loop continuously check the call-stack and callback queue. Here How It works?
                <ol type="I">
                    <li>If call-stack is empty in event loop will take the first task from callback queue.</li>
                    <li>It will push that task into the all stack and execute it .</li>
                    <li>This process repeats the events the event loop keeps checking the stack and queue untill
                        there are no more task in the queue. </li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li>
                <u>Microtasks And Macrotask :</u>
                JavaScript distinguished between two types of task :
                <ol type="A">
                    <li>
                        <span>MAcrotask :</span>
                        The tasks that include things like setTimeOut, setInterval and I/O
                        operations. They are processed in the order the arrive in the callback queue. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Microtasks :</span>
                        There are typically related to promisses (like .then(), .catch() or async/await)
                        Microtasks have higher priority than Macrotasks and will be processed 
                        immediately after the currently executing script and before the next Macrotask is processed.
                    </li>
                </ol> 
            </li>
        </ol>
